# Inventory Performance Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of inventory performance using **Power BI**. The primary goal is to identify key insights that can optimize warehouse management, improve supply chain efficiency, and enhance supplier performance. 

The analysis is centered around various KPIs such as:
- **Inventory Turnover**
- **Stock Levels**
- **Supplier Performance**
- **Product Sales** 
- And more.

### Objectives:
- **Evaluate stock levels** to avoid overstocking or understocking situations.
- **Monitor supplier performance** by tracking on-time deliveries and return rates.
- **Assess product movement** through shipment trends and customer return rates.
- **Identify bottlenecks** in warehouse processes such as receipt-to-inspection and bin placement delays.

This project uses **synthetic data generated in Python**, simulating real-world warehouse operations, supplier interactions, and inventory management scenarios.

## Key Insights
- Uncover **seasonal demand trends**.
- Optimize stock placement across multiple warehouses.
- Identify **underperforming suppliers** or products with high return rates.
- Improve operational efficiency by minimizing delays in product inspections and shipments.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python**: For generating synthetic data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
